        <td><p>Our solution to these problems is that we decided to use renewable energy (sunlight and wind energy) for boiling and evaporating the water of seas and oceans and condensing it on an angled surface by(10 to 18) Celsius on the top of the container to help the condensed water slip into the water tanks to exploit the great amount of salty water in Egypt and in all the world, firstly by sunlight using two spherical lenses (convex) specially to make sunlight more focused on the water as it collects the sunlight in one point (focal point) to make the sunlight nearer to the water that is calculated by this law (a=2arctan*d/2/f) as (a) refers to the angle, (d) to diameter and (f) to focal length and by using a servo, Arduino and two LDR sensors to use them in a tracking system to track the sunlight  to reduce the time of boiling. 

            Secondly wind energy we used wind energy by using a turbine to generate electric energy and changing it to heat energy, as the turbine rotates by the wind and generates electric energy by the motor that is connected to the Peltier and is putted under the container of water and makes the water boils faster. 
            
            Lastly about filters and in this phase, we filter the polluted water at first before evaporating and condensing it from the pollutants that are not removed by evaporating as oils and its derivatives that is filtered by polyproline fibers It absorbs oil but not water , and after that filter which compose of the charcoal layer that removes alcohol too , and some chemicals as {herbicides (sulfonylurea, aryloxyalcanoic acids, chloroacetanilides), insecticides (pyrethroids, carbamates) as biofilters and fungicides (dicarboximides, phenylamines, triazoles and strobilurins). that came from industrial drainage and at the end this pure water is collected in water tanks that are connected to pipes to deliver the fresh pure water to these poor houses. And in our preparation, we found that this device is suitable for the cost areas that has sunlight and strong wind. </p></td>
